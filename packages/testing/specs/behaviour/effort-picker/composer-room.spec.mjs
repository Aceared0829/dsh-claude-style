/**
 * The composer's seat is one item in the row: the model's name and the effort
 * level share a box that stands against the row's right end and grows leftward,
 * and the context meter's ring stands after that box, in the row's own flow. A
 * level's name changing width moves the box's left end and leaves the edge both
 * cards hang from where it was; a card too narrow for the row shortens the
 * model's name before it takes the ring out of the card.
 *
 * @capability effort-picker
 * @features effort, model, context-stats
 * @risk In a narrow window the ring covers the model's name or pushes the composer wider than the window, and the conversation grows a horizontal scrollbar.
