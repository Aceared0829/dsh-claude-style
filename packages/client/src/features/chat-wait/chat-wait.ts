 * The live turn's running row: what the turn is doing now in this line's own

 * can be read — the skin's own 「正在思考」 under the Claude brand, the host's own
 * 「深度求索中」 under the DeepSeek brand — the turn's elapsed time as a quiet
 * clock beside it, and 「暂未响应」 once the model has been silent for ten seconds
 * (wait-state.ts). Under the
 * Precise choice three of those states name more than a state: a call in
 * flight says the file it works on (「正在读取 app.js」) or the description it
 * declares for itself (a command call must carry one), and reasoning says the
 * clause the model itself is on (「Checking the file is true」); the Simple
 * choice reads the bare states alone. A wording written stands a whole second
 * (wordForPass), so a turn that moves through several states that fast reads as
 * one line rather than as flicker. The wording swaps in place after
 * transitions.dev's "Thinking states" (MIT): a sweeping highlight while a word
 * stands, and a two-copy swap when it changes (shared/swapping-text.ts).
 *
 * The host keeps its row, its divider and its live region: the line is a span of
 * the skin's own beside the host's own icon, marked quiet so its ticking wakes
 * no pass, and the stylesheet hides the host's words while it stands
 * (chat-wait.css). Under the Claude brand the host's whale tail gives way to the
 * skin's own loading dots, which lead the line where the whale did. The words,
 * the clock's units and the session's turns are the host's.
 *
 * @param ctx - client context.
 * @param ui - shared handle table.
 * @returns teardown.
