 * The footer entries the skin keeps in the sidebar (constants.ts, FOOTER_SEATS):
 * the update control among them. The takeover hides a footer entry and rebuilds
 * it as a row of the account popover; an entry with a seat stays where the
 * plugin put it in the reader's eyes instead — the plugin's own node stays in
 * its slot and this module stands a copy of it inside the account row, so the
 * plugin keeps its own markup, icon, label, progress and click behaviour, and
 * the skin only gives it a place in the row.
 *
 * The copy is rebuilt when the plugin's markup changes and forwards every
 * press to the live entry: the plugin's handlers are bound to its own node, so
 * the copy never owns state of its own.
