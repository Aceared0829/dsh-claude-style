 * The composer's idle hint, in the skin's own words and the shell's language.

 * attachment, and one whose field answers for something else. The skin's own
 * words go where a shipped hint already stands, and where the host draws none
 * for a card the skin covers — the attachment form, a draft of images alone —
 * the skin adds its own hint (`data-dsh-synthetic-placeholder`).
 *
 * A commit of the host's runs several passes, and the pass after a stand-in's
 * write reads the card the way it did before: the stand-in carries the pass
 * that drew it, and only a later pass takes it back once the card has moved on.
 * Whether the card holds a hint of the host's is read on the card itself: the
 * bus may still hold a hint the page has already dropped.
 *
 * The words follow the shell's locale rather than the hint already on the
 * node, because a locale switch and a rebuild between two passes need not
 * arrive in one order: a writer that only moves a shipped hint across would
 * leave the previous language standing.
 *
 * @param cards - the composer cards, kept current by the bus (D40).
 * @param placeholders - the placeholders those cards carry, from the same source.
