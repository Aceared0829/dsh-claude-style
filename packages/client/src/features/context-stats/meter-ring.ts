/**
 * The context meter's own ring in the composer row.
 *
 * The host's meter cannot leave the dock the host renders it in — moving it out
 * crashed React's unmount — so the skin draws the ring itself, and the host's
 * node stays where it is and leaves the row unpainted: it keeps only the job of
 * opening its own context panel, which stats-binding.ts presses its trigger
 * for. The ring is the skin's own node, appended after the seat box in the
 * host's model slot (features/model/seat-box.ts is the same arrangement), so
 * the row lays it out and shortens the model's name before it.
 *
 * The reading is the host's projection of the session's context pressure. A
 * host that serves none is read off its own ring's text, which is still in the
 * document behind the paint. The ring's look is the face the reader picked
 * (context-meter-face.ts): the pie in the continuous band, dsh's thin ring in
 * that band, or the measured ring in three bands, with the number beside it.
