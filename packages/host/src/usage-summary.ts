/**
 * Merging the per-session folds into one day map, and shaping the payload the
 * `usage` route answers with.
 *
 * The merge keeps the ids behind each day, because the dashboard unions session
 * ids over an arbitrary range window instead of summing per-day counts (a session
 * spanning two days is one session). The payload's `hours` arrays are the one
 * figure the fold alone can supply; the ledger has no hour dimension.
 *
 * The cost meter's ledger and our own fold are two accounts of the same days, so
 * they combine by date and never by addition: a day the ledger knows is the
 * ledger's, and only the dates past its newest come from the fold. Adding
 * the fold's days on top of the ledger's would count the same settlements twice.
