/**
 * page-scale.ts — the host's floating layer in a page the skin draws at a scale
 * (D43, D81).
 *
 * The skin draws the page at the reader's own scale by putting `zoom` on the
 * body (packages/client/src/theme/chrome.css, docs/STYLE.md). A box laid out
 * inside that scaling is drawn at the scale, and a length written into it is
 * read through the same scale again: a host card that measures a row in the
 * viewport's pixels and writes that box whole comes out at the square of the
 * scale. Worse, the host measures its own card in the page's pixels while it
 * measures the row it hangs from in the viewport's, so a card placed from its
 * own height — a menu opening over its trigger — lands short of it by the
 * height's share of the scale.
 *
 * Both come from one cause: the host writes its placement for a box that is one
 * pixel to one pixel with the window. What is given back here is that box, and
 * only to the host's own floating cards: the card's own space is drawn at the
 * page's scale divided out again, so a length the host writes and a box the host
 * measures are the same length on screen.
 *
 * The skin's own cards are placed by the skin, which reads the scale itself
 * (packages/client/src/shared/page-zoom.ts), and are left alone.
